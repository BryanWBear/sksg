SKSG stands for Shitty Killer Sudoku Generator. Killer sudoku is a sudoku variant where instead of getting starting numbers, the board is partitioned into disjoint cages, and you're given the sum of each cage. 

Here's what a board looks like:

The reason why it's a "shitty" sudoku generator is because I drew all of the cage assets using my mouse. Also the algorithm I used is some shitty homegrown variation of the (poorly-named) wavefunction-collapse algorithm. There is no guarantee of the uniqueness of generated boards.
